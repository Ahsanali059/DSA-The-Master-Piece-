A spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph is a subgraph that includes all the vertices of the original graph with the minimum number of edges required to keep all the vertices connected. In other words, it is a tree that spans all the vertices of the graph.


Key Properties of a Spanning Tree

    Connected: A spanning tree must include all the vertices and must be connected. There should be a path between any pair of vertices.
    Acyclic: A spanning tree must not contain any cycles.
    Edges: If a graph has VV vertices, a spanning tree will have exactly V−1V−1 edges.

    Example:
    A -- B (1)
    A -- C (2)
    B -- C (3)
    B -- D (4)
    C -- D (5)
    One Possible tree is ....
    A -- B (1)
    A -- C (2)
    B -- D (4)
