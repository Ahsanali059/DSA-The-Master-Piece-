package Graph.articulationPoints;

//An articulation point, also known as a cut vertex, is a crucial node in a graph whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. In simpler terms, it's a vertex in a graph such that if you were to remove it along with all edges incident to it, the graph would split into two or more separate connected components.
