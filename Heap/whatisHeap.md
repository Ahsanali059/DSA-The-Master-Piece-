Create Heap time complexity => O(N)



A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues, but they also have a wide range of other applications. There are two main types of heaps: min-heaps and max-heaps.

Types of Heaps:

Min-Heap:

The key at the root must be minimum among all keys present in the heap.
The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in the heap.
This means that every parent node is less than or equal to its child nodes.

Max-Heap:

The key at the root must be maximum among all keys present in the heap.
=>Heap all work do in constant time 
Max Heap =>Max element always on the root position 

Min Heap =>Min element always root element  

The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in the heap.
This means that every parent node is greater than or equal to its child nodes.

properties of Heap:

=>Heap is a complete binary tree exacept the possibility of last level filled from left to right 

=>Heap property:In case of min heap each parent node is less then or equal to its child for max Heaps,each parent node is greater than or equal to its children.
