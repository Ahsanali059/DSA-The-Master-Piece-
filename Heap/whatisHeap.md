A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues, but they also have a wide range of other applications. There are two main types of heaps: min-heaps and max-heaps.

Types of Heaps:

Min-Heap:

The key at the root must be minimum among all keys present in the heap.
The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in the heap.
This means that every parent node is less than or equal to its child nodes.

Max-Heap:

The key at the root must be maximum among all keys present in the heap.
The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in the heap.
This means that every parent node is greater than or equal to its child nodes.
