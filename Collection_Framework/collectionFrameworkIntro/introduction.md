Type of data structure:

=>Primitive data structure
           Examples:Integer,Character,float,double,byte,short,long,boolean 
=>Non-primitive data structure:
           Examples:String,Files,Arrays,Collection,Map,HashMap,Stack,ArrayList,Linkedlist

Application of arrays:

=>Arrays are used to store vaiables that reduce the number of varaibles we need to declare to store data before arrays 

=>arrays can store homogenouos data type 

=>arrays are used to developed or build sorting algorithm,bubble sort,merge short,quick short,selection sort,insertion sort 

=>Arrays can be used to perform Matrix operations 
=>Arrays can be used in Cpu Scheduling 

=>Arrays are used to implement ds like stack,queues,linkedlist etc 


Point to rememeber Arrays & Collection Framework ? 

=>Arrays are java Inbuild feature provided by sun micro system are used to build algorithm and insert and delete data operations 

=>Collection Framework are api feature.It provides predifined classes and interfaces and methods by which we can easily iterate or delete or sort the element 

=>Array Can store primitive(int,char,etc) and non primitive(objects) data types 

=>Collections Frameworks only store non primitive data types 

=>Arrays can store only homogenous type of data 

=>Collection can store different type of data 

=>The size of array cannot increase in runtime according to our requirement 

=>The size of collection can Increrase in runtime according to our requirements 

=>Arrays are not good with respect to memory 

=>Collections are good to with respect to memory
