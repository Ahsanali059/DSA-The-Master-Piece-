What is Binary Tree
===================
A Binary tree is hierarchical data structure where:
   -> Each node has at most two children called the left child and right child.
   -> It start from a root node and branches out.
   -> There is not specific rule about the values of the children compared to the parent.

  3   7

Note: This is a valid binary tree. The values can be in any order.

===============================
What is BST(Binary Search Tree)
===============================

-> BST is a special type of Tree jis mai do rules hota ha 
Rule 1: Parent left sa barha ho ga
Rule 2  Parent right sa chota ho ga

Why is it useful?
Enables fast search, insert, and delete operations.

In a balanced BST, these operations take O(log n) time.
