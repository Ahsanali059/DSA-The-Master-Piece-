`Backtracking` is a `problem-solving` algorithmic technique that involves finding a solution incrementally by trying different options and undoing them if they lead to a dead end. It is commonly used in situations where you need to explore multiple possibilities to solve a problem, like searching for a path in a maze or solving puzzles like Sudoku. When a dead end is reached, the algorithm backtracks to the previous decision point and explores a different path until a solution is found or all possibilities have been exhausted.

`what is difference between backtracking and recursion`

->Recursion does not always need backtracking
->Backtracking always uses recursion to solve problems

->Solving problems by breaking them into smaller, similar subproblems and solving them recursively.

->Solving problems with multiple choices and exploring options systematically, backtracking when needed.

->Controlled by function calls and call stack.

->Managed explicitly with loops and state.

->Applications of Recursion: Tree and Graph Traversal, Towers of Hanoi, Divide and Conquer Algorithms, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Binary Search.

->Application of Backtracking: N Queen problem, Rat in a Maze problem, Knightâ€™s Tour Problem, Sudoku solver, and Graph coloring problems.
